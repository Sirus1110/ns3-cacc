Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) 
-----------------------------------


The CACC application is implemented in ns3. The example application uses 802.11p helper functions. 
To simulate the CACC application:
The arguments are defined as shown:
• RANDSEED = Random Seed set to the random number generator in ns-3
• NumberofNodes = Total number of vehicles in the platoon to simulate starting
with front vehicle 0
• Datarate = bit rate for broadcast network in kbps
• PacketSize = size of broadcast message to use (typically 200 B)
• SimTime = total length of time for simulation to run
• Phymode = ns-3 specific defines that abstract the type of Modulation and
Coding to be used in 802.11p network ( typically, Rate 1/2 QPSK is given as
OfdmRate6MbpsBW10MHz)
• PlatoonLength = number of vehicles starting from the front vehicle counted as 0
to actually participate in a platoon ( usually PlatoonLength = NumberofNodes)
• HeadwayTime = set h value in seconds
• Accln Profile = type of acceleration profile to be used for the Leader vehicle
(the acceleration profile files are named with ’.acc’ extension
• Caccupdatetime = time span between consecutive CACC updates
• Moveupdatetime = time span between consecutive piece wise linear acceleration
updates used for vehicle mobility
• Leaderupdatetime = time span between consecutive Leader vehicle’s acceleration
updates
• Dref = reference distance in feet.
• ACC basic, CACC U, CACC A, CACC DU and CACC RU = selection on type
of CACC (with wireless or without wireless and only using sensors) and ACC
to simulate
• DMEupdatetime = time span between consecutive Sensor updates
• LogfileLocation = folder location to store all the log files generated per simulation
• LossStartTime = start time in seconds w.r.t the simulation start time when the
loss process acting on the wireless network becomes active
• LossDuration = length of time since the LossStartTime till the loss process is
active
• numLossVehicles = number of vehicles a↵ected by the loss process
• MeanBurstLength = MBL for loss process simulation
• MeanGoodLength = MGL for loss process simulation
• BackupMode = fall back CACC mode to be used in case the wireless network
drops packets
• distnNoise = standard deviation used to simulate noise in distance measurements
• velnoise = standard deviation used to simulate noise in velocity measurements
After the simulation finishes, the log files will be stored in LogLocation. A set of
different log files contain mobility information (acceleration, velocity, position) about
each platooning vehicles, their communication logs ( received time, sent time, packet
counter and RSSI in dBm), and CACC related logs (distance error, target acceleration).
